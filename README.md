# SLR1-Parser

This is a project for **Compilation Principle experiment** in the autumn semester of 2021. In order to improve the interactivity and user experience, I realized this experiment in the form of web page. The following picture is the main interface of this project.

This web page uses **JavaScript** language to simulate the compilation of simple **C** language programs, which only involves the relevant steps of **lexical analysis** and **syntax analysis**. Enter the C language program code in the text area and click the button, and then you will get the results of **SLR(1) syntax analysis**. After the analysis, you can see the results of each step in detail.

Thank you for visiting this repository. Any comments and suggestions are welcome.
